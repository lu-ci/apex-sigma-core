# Frequently Asked Questions

*Sigh...*

## Will you add a command that sells all non-recipe items?

No.

## Does my PC need to be on for the bot to run?

Yes. Unless you rent a server to run it non-stop. I recommand Scaleway.
We use their Dedibox service and rent a dedicated server for Sigma.

## How can I see the stuff stored in the database?

There are multiple tools that can access MongoDB, I use Robo3T.

## Music commands don't work!

If you're self-hosting, make sure text-only mode is off and
that FFMPEG is set up correctly.
Otherwise, yes, because music is off for the main instance.
Too performance costly to keep publicly available.

## What is "earned" Kud?

Kud obtained from minigames that aren't gambling.
Kud generated from admins also doesn't count towards it.

## I have a suggestion, where can I send it?

You can submit a suggestion from anywhere you want with `>>botsuggest`.
The message gets sent to our `#sigma-suggestions` channel.
You can also open an issue on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/lu-ci/sigma/apex-sigma) if you want.

## I submitted a GIF for an interaction but have never seen it, where is it?

Two possibilities, either you're really unlucky or it wasn't approved.
All GIFs are manually approved before they're in the interaction pool.
...the things people have submitted, man...

## What requirements does a GIF have to meet?

- It needs to be appropriate for the interaction type it was submitted for.
- Safe GIFs for SFW interactions, unsafe GIFs for NSFW interactions.
- The resolution and framerate needs to be sufficiently high.
- The GIF must be anime. RL gifs and sketches are a no.
- No excessive gore.
