## Prologue

This is a guide on how to host your own instance of Sigma as well as how
to use her internal framework for writing new commands and events.
I'm gonna be honest with you, Sigma is open source because of transparency.
This project is **not easy** to set up or very friendly for beginners.
Be aware of that before proceeding. If you can't find somethin here,
you can always drop by [Lucia's Cipher](https://discord.gg/aEUCHwX) and ask.
Whoever's online will help you, start to finish.
