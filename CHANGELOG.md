## 4.66.1323 Yuria

### Added

- The `heal` command has been added for the event. You can heal all your missing vigor, or a specified amount. You can
  also heal others.
- Event leaderboard commands, which are `>>topsweets` and `>>toppumpkin` have been added.
- The `grow` command was added that lets you grow your pumpkin. The more sweets you spend at once, the more it grows.
  The formula determining the gained weight is a positive exponential curve.
- Added the `steal` command that has consequences if you fail. It's used for stealing sweets. Failure means getting
  cursed, losing lots of vigor, and losing some Kud.
- A passive sweets adding mechanism has been added to messages. If the message and the guild meet criteria, a piece of
  candy will be given to the user. There's also a low chance for 6 to be added instead.
- The `enchant` command has been added with the ability to enchant a user. Enchanted users get higher amounts of candy
  during the event. Up to two users can enchant a user at a time and enchantments last for **2 hours**. Getting cursed
  wipes any active enchantments, so be careful.
- The curse mechanic was added. Atempting to do something bad during the event, such as stealing sweets, has a chance to
  get you cursed which has various negative effects such as reducing Vigor, which in turn has it's own negative effects.
- The `pumpkin` command and Weight resource for the spooktober event. The resource is in milligrams, the displayed value
  is in kilograms. This one also has fancy visuals!
- Added the FetchHelper class. It has it's own memory cacher to not spam the REST endpoint. Adds the ability to safely
  retrieve data about objects that are not in the general cache or obtainable from `get_<object>()` functions.
- Added detailed command statistics tracking for use in the upcoming profile rework. Such as your most used commands,
  arguments, most active guilds and channels, etc.
- The `trickortreat` command that gives you sweets if successfull. Includes chances for bonus candy.
- The `sweets` command and Sweets resource for the spooktober event (with fancy image generating!).
- The `vigor` command and Vigor resource for the spooktober event. Vigor affects your event cooldowns and chances.

### Changed

- The `daily` command now gives **+1 {Currency}** for each consecutive day.
- Replaced the `.replace()` directives in FFXIV Timers with `.shift()` due to deprecation of the former method causing
  errors.
- Overridden getter functions will use the FetchHelper to try to get invisible data.
- Added a catch-all exception for the dominant color processing handler.
- Fixed the interaction origin showing "Unknown User/Server" even when there is data where the interaction came from.
- Finding items of a **Spectral** or **Ethereal** rarity awards you sweets.

## 4.60.1201 Maka

### Changed

- You can now set a custom raffle icon with `>>raffleicon`. This needs to be an emote from the server you're starting
  the raffle from.
- Mentioning a channel in a `raffle` command will now start the raffle in that channel instead of the one where the
  command is executed in. Sigma will check if the user starting the raffle has the permission to Send Messages in that
  channel before starting said raffle.
- Fix global emote caching issues when using a redis or mixed cache. The cache will now be MemoryCached, forcibly, for
  this.
- The `spouses` command now sorts the users properly. This was only an issue when someone with database access started
  fucking with the data (me).
- The `spouses` command now displays a more accurate time since you got married to a user.
- The `divorce` command got a facelift. You are now presented with a dialogue and options on how to proceed with the
  divorce. You can ask for a mutual one which will have no cost or force the divorce costing you based on the time you
  spent married (and display the value). The final option is withdrawing the divorce proposal. Using the divorce command
  with an ID instead of a mention will not give you an option for a mutual divorce but will still display the dialogue
  and the cost of forcing the divorce.
- Slap now has a `smack` alias.
- Punch now has a `hit` alias.

## 4.57.1146 Taiga

### Added

- The `>>tackle` interaction is now a thing. Holding a dev hostage to make it is not ok...

### Changed

- Sleep now has a `nap` alias.
- Drink now has a `cheers` alias.

## 4.57.1145 Taiga

### Changed

- The formula used for scaling quiz-type minigames has been altered. Because I got asked this earlier, taking trivia for
  reference, there is no maximum amount of Kud you can get from the minigame. However, there is an effective one due to
  the nature of a reverse exponential formula. The effective limits for trivia's **Easy/Medium/Hard/Average** would
  be **760/1520/3795/2025 Kud**, in that order.

## 4.57.1144 Taiga

### Changed

- Added a small `>>dictionary` safeguard for GRAMB type attribute errors.
- Added a small `>>jisho` safeguard for the field title value.

### Changed

  formula is
  ```py
  int(sum(ingredient_values) * (3 * (0.075 * sum(ingredient_rarities))) / 100) * 100
  ```
- Items now have hardcoded values per rarity (this was always the case, but they were in the item YAMLs).
- Tweaked some comments in `>>purge` to be more accurate.
- Cleaned up the changelog a bit. Slightly less spelling and grammatical mistakes.
- Changed the trigger checker function for auto reactors/responders to remove punctuation.
- Added a unique user safeguard to prevent one user from spamming the reaction.
- Added broad targeting to `ban`, `hardmute`, `hardunmute`, `kick`, `softban`, `voicekick` and `issuewarning`. Be
  careful with broad targeting when using names.

- Changed `>>starboardchannel` to use the current channel if one isn't mentioned.
- Fixed an error in `starboard_watcher` resulting in disabling the starboard having no effect.

## 4.40.809: Mirakurun

- Interactions will not try to fill missing user and guild data for usage in the footer text.
- The order of the `get_scaled()` arguments has been changed for more logic, it also takes the maximum multiplier cap as
  an argument.
- The profession emote reactions are back. Here's what happened with this. People were pissed about it being made, and

  an icon.
- Fix markov chain commands sometimes failing due to upstream `KeyError` instances that make no goddamn sense.

  scaled time is slightly randomized and exponential with a passive cleaning method and cap.
- The `>>massban` command was added by *Shifty*. Bans all mentioned users.
- The `>>masskick` command was added by *Shifty*. Kicks all mentioned users.

  by *Shifty* to be clearer that you can only disown immediate family members.
- The `errors.py` core file was renamed to `error.py` by *Shifty*. Reason being that the file name should be
  consistently singular.

### Removed

- Profession emote interaction validation.

## 4.35.730: Ange

### Added

- The `>>roleswithpermission` (the `>>rlwperm` for short) command has been made. It lists all roles that have a given
  permission or list of permissions separated by a `; ` (semicolon). You can reverse the search so it shows that don't
  have the permission by adding `--negative` to the end of the command.

## 4.35.726: Ange

### Added

- Created the `CacherConfiguration` class that handles all `Cacher` classes. This adds a new core config file
  at `config/core/cache.yml` that should contain the cacher parameters. Those are: `type` for the type of `Cacher` to
  use, `size` for the max number of items in LRU and TTL caches, `time` for the time-to-live time limit in the TTL
  cache, and `host` and `port` for the Redis and Mixed cachers.

### Changed

- The `>>adopt` command now requires emote reaction confirmation that they agree to being adopted.
- The `>>familytree` command now uploads a yaml file instead of posting the contents to hastebin due to hastebin's low
  storage allowance.

  trying to contact discord if the token is `None`.

## 4.35.712: Ange

### Added

- Created the `ModuleConfig` class that wraps command config data for future configuration expansions.
- The initial `run.py` file now checks for any import errors. If detected, it'll try to install the requirements file.
- The ChatterBot Core returns! Brought back AI without ChatterBot, now with AIML... it's good enough.

### Changed

- The `SigmaEvent` class now has a `path` attribute and `resource()` method like the one for commands.
- Updated all copyright comments from 2018 to 2019.
- All instances of `plugin` have been renamed to `module`. Meaning that you need to rename `config/plugins`
  to `config/modules`.
- Family tree consistency fixes by *Shifty*.

## 2019-02-12

### Changed

- Major family module fixes. Added sibling checks and make recursion issues less likely.
- Fixed the `>>colorme` hex color safeguard check.
- Fixed the `>>adopt` response not being assigned to the response variable when targeting bots.

## 2019-02-10

### Changed

- Renamed `>>packages` to `>>pythonpackage`, packages is too broad and has no correlation with what the command does.

## 2019-02-09

### Changed

- No longer able to `>>adopt` bots.
- Clean the `.name` attribute of `AdoptableHuman` because fuck special characters.
- Have the `.name` attribute of `AdoptableHuman` update when they're interacted with.

### Added

- The family tree functions have been added. You can `>>adopt` people, if you don't like them you can `>>disown` them.
  If you want to see your entire family tree from start to end use `>>familytree` and it will generate a nice little
  link with your entire tree in it. A thing to note that is that this mimics an actual biological family tree, meaning
  that you can't have more than 2 parents, cause biology.

### Changed

- Renamed all instances of the method `dictify()` to `to_dict()`. It's more uniform and logical.

## 2019-02-07

### Added

- The `>>sniff` interaction has been added. I have no official reason behind this besides liking the idea of lewd
  sniffs. Just being honest...

## 2019-02-05

### Added

- The `>>visualnoveldatabase` (I know it's long, use `>>vndb` or `>>vn` instead) command was revived. Now with 100% less
  locks and 100% more async. It looks up visual novels, obviously.

## 2019-02-04

### Changed

- Fixed the `>>spelledlike` command. That issue was there for a long time but nobody really uses this command...

### Added

- Selling your entire inventory or selling items with a filter will trigger a confirmation dialogue for the user to
  confirm their sale.
- The bool dialogue generator now takes a `tracked: bool` argument that records how long the user took to respond.

### Changed

- The interaction addition is now a whitelist mechanic. Instead of being able to remove submitted interactions with
  an `❌` emote reaction to the log message, you now approve it instead with a `✅`. Unless approved, the interaction will
  not be used. Sigma will then add a `🆗` reaction of her own if successfully approved.

## 2019-01-22

### Changed

- Server renamed to Support in the `>>help` command and make the command link lead to the website once again.
- Fix the invite URL in the `CONTRIBUTING.md` document and remove the nonexistent setup link.

  was undelivered, specifying the lookup or delivery failure.

- Refactored `module.yml` files automatically for visual alignment and clarity.
- The `>>youtube` command was repaired by *Shifty*.

## 2019-01-19

### Changed

- The logger files contain shard numbers in them in the format of `sigma.{shard}.{date}.log`.
- The way the `>>play` command executes the `>>summon`, `>>queue` and `>>donate` commands are executed now use their raw
  methods instead of the `.execute(pld: CommandPayload)` method of the `SigmaCommand` class.
- Generic responses implementation by *Shifty*, second pass.

## 2019-01-18

### Changed

- Generic responses implementation by *Shifty*, first pass.
