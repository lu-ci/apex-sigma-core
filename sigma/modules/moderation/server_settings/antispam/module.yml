                  The default is a minimum of 5 capital letters and 60% of the message being caps.
                  This can be controlled with the "capslimit" and "capspercentage" commands.

  - name:         capslimit
    enabled:      true
    usage:        "{pfx}{cmd} 9"
    description:
                  Sets the minimum number of capital letters in a message to check for before
                  the message is checked for what percentage of it is in caps.
                  Message below this limit will be ignored.

  - name:         capspercentage
    alts:
      - "capspercent"
    enabled:      true
    usage:        "{pfx}{cmd} 80"
    description:
                  Sets the minimum percentage of capital letters in a message to check for before it is deleted.
                  For example, if 80% of the message is caps (as set in the usage example), it will be deleted.

                  Toggles the antispam limiter.
                  This basically enforces a custom rate limiter upon users.
                  The default is 5 messages per 5 seconds.

  - name:         ratelimit
    enabled:      true
    usage:        "{pfx}{cmd} 6:10"
    description:
                  Sets the message amount and timespan for the rate limiter.
                  Separated by a colon, the amount goes first and timespan second.
                  The usage example translates to a limit of 6 messages per 10 seconds.
                  Any messages that cross this limit will be deleted.
