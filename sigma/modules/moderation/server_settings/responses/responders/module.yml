    description: Sets chatterbot parameters. You can use the built-in AIML or you can customize these settings.
      The accepted things to set are "mode", "key", "model", "endpoint" and "directive".
      The mode can be "aiml", "custom" or "none" (or blank). None acts the same as AIML since that's the default.
      The key is your API key to use with your selected service. This is stored as encrypted data.
      Leaving it blank will delete your key from the database.
      The model is the model name you wish to use.
      The endpoint is the API URI you wish to call for your service.
      The directive is instructions to use for your model, we provide some basic ones by default but you can change it.
