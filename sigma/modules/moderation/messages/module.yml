      - prune
    description: Deletes messages matching the given filters. There is a hard
      cap of 100 messages per purge. Mentioning a user will only delete their
      messages. Providing a limit will only delete within the last X messages.
      Omitting the user and limit will only delete Sigma's messages. There are
      several arguments avaiable to filter what's deleted. "attachments" only
      delete messages with attachments. "emotes" only delete messages that are
      emotes. "untilpin" stop deleting when a pin is reached. "content:thing to
      delete" only delete messages including "thing to delete". Due to this including
      everything after the ":", it's recommended this be the last argument. This
      command requires the Manage Messages permission.
