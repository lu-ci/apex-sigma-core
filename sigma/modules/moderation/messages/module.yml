  - prune
  description: Deletes any messages posted by the mentioned user within the last X
    messages. If a user is not provided, it will prune the last X messages regardless
    of poster. If a number is not provided it will prune all messages posted by the
    mentioned user within the last 100 messages. If neither number nor user is provided,
    it will prune Sigma's messages within the last 100 messages. If you add "attachments"
    to the command arguments it will only purge messages that have attachments. If
    you add "emotes" to the command arguments it will only purge messages that are
    just emotes. If you add "content:something you want gone" to the command arguments
    it will only delete messages that have the specified content after "content:"
    in them, which can be a word or a sentence. Due to content catching everything
    after the ":" in it, it's suggested to be the last argument in the command. This
    command requires the Manage Messages permission.
