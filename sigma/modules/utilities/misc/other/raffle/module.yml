      Starts a raffle with a given timer and title.
      Entering the raffle works by reacting to Sigma's embed message
      with an automatically given reaction. When the timer runs out
      a message will appear in the channel the raffle was made in
      and the creator of the raffle and the winner will be tagged.

      Redraws a raffle in case that's ever needed.
      This command is only usable by the author of the raffle.
      To redraw a raffle use the raffle's ID that can be found in its footer.
      This command has no response aside from a reaction to your message.
      If all is well, a green check will appear, if the user is not the author, it will be a no entry sign,
      if a raffle with that ID is not found, a magnifying glass will be the reaction, if no arguments are
      provided, it will be an exclamation mark.
      A raffle needs to be marked as ended before it can be redrawn.

      If you are not the creator of the raffle, a no entry sign.
      If no ID is given, an exclamation.
