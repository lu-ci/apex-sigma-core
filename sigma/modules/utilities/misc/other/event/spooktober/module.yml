    description: Enchants your target user.
      Enchantments modify the value of candy received.
      Up to 2 enchantments can be active at a time and cost 20 Sweets.
      Cursed users can't be enchanted and any active enchantments will be lost
      if the user gets cursed. They last 2 hours.

    description: Steal another user's sweets.
      Be careful, because failing to do so has consequences.
      You'll lose vigor, Kud, and even get cursed.
      Does your sweet tooth outweigh those risks?

    description: Makes your pumpkin grow.
      The default value it uses is 10
      but you can input any amount of sweets you want to use.
      You'll be prompted if you agree. The amount of weight the pumpkin
      gains is a positive exponential. The more sweets you give it in a bulk
      the more weight it gains. So stock up on sweets and dump it all on it at once.
