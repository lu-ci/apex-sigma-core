    usage:        "{pfx}{cmd} @person #channel"
    description:
      Collects messages sent by the mentioned user and saves it as a chain.
      Only one chain can be collected at a time so a queue is used.
      If a user isn't mentioned, it will collect a chain for the author.
      If a channel isn't mentioned, it will collect items from the current channel.

    usage:        "{pfx}{cmd}"
    description:
      Toggles the ability for other users to collect a chain for you.
      If active, only you will be able to collect a Markov chain for yourself.
      If not, the collector works as always, where anybody can start a chain collection for you.

      Encrypts the message of your choice using Sigma's Heart Key.
      The message can be decrypted using the decrypt command.
      You can add ":t" at the end to force it to be raw text instead of an embed.

  - name:         impersonate
    alts:
      - "mimic"
    enabled:      true
    usage:        "{pfx}{cmd} @person"
    description:
      Tries to impersonate the mentioned user if a chain file for them exists.
      The more items in your chain you have, the better the output.
      Having a low number of items, or having items that aren't good enough, might
      result in Sigma not being able to generate anything. The optimal amount is 5000 items.
      You can check how many items you have with the chain command.
