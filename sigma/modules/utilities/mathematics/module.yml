    description: Collects messages sent by the mentioned user and saves it as a chain.

      it will collect items from the current channel.

    description: Tries to impersonate the mentioned user if a chain file for them exists.
      A larger chain will yield a better output. Having a small chain, or chain items that
      aren't good enough, might result in no output being generated. The optimal chain size
      is above 5000. You can view your chain size via the chain command. You can specify
      either a character limit, or a starting state of one to two words (not both). At least
      one item in your chain must contain the specified starting state for this to work.
      One word starting states are more likely to work than two word starting states.
