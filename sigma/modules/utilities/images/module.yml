    description: Shows the mentioned user's avatar. If no user is mentioned, it shows
      the author's avatar. You can add "gif" to the end of the command to indicate that
      it's a gif. Or you can add "auto" to show the predominant color of the image.
      You can also add "static" to the end to make it return the full sized static version
      of your avatar.

  - alts:
      - emoji
      - em
    description: Searches for an emoji. You can use the actual emoji or just its name.
      If you use its name you can make the search more precise by adding the ID of the
      emote or server ID that the emote is from, like in this example "monika:375824498882117635".
      By default this searches emotes on the current server. If you wish to search emotes
      on all servers, add "--global" as the last argument. Note that this makes the
      command NSFW due to the possibility of other server's emotes being explicit.

  - alts:
      - addemoji
    description: Adds the desired emote to the server. Specify an emote by reacting to the command
      message with it. You can specify a name for the emote, otherwise it will use the existing name.
      This command requires the Manage Emotes permission.
