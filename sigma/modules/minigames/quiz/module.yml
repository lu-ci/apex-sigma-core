  description: A trivia minigame. You are given a question and have to input the number
    of your answer. Guess correctly and you win 10-50 Kud (base), depending on the
    difficulty. You have 20 seconds to answer the question. Consecutive correct answers
    give you a streak and the streak increases the Kud gained for each correct answers.
    Timing out or giving an incorrect answer resets the streak. You can choose the
    category and difficulty of the question like in the usage example, but choosing
    either will disable the streak.
