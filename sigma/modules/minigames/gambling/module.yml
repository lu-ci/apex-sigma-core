      Who knows? The default bet is 10 Kud but you can specify any amount you want.
      The rewards are based on how many of the same icon you get
      in the middle row. Rewards are different for each icon.
      The slots can be spun only once every 60 seconds.

      Spin the roulette wheel and maybe you'll win.
      The default bet is 10 Kud but you can specify any amount you want.
      The syntax of playing is the bet amount first, it can be ommitted however,
      and then the roulette spot choice in the form of [selector]:[value].
      Accepted specifiers are color:b or number:15, column:2, dozen:1, half:1, and type:odd.
      Good luck.
