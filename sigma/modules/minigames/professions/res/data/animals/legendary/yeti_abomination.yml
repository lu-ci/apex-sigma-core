description:
  The corrupted yeti is a twisted horror, a yeti defiled by dark necromantic forces. 
  It appears larger than an average yeti, more bestial and malevolent. 
  It takes pleasure in inflicting pain, toying with its prey, a malicious stalker, and relishes in the feeling of warm blood upon its fur.
