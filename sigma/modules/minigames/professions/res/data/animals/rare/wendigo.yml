description:
  The Wendigo were once humanoids, taken to cannibalism due to starvation or dark rituals for power.
  A steady diet of sentient flesh has twisted and warped the eater into a Wendigo, an immortal terror with an insatiable appetite.
  Wendigo retain their human minds but often act as mindless beasts the hungrier they get.
  A wendigo may not age, but can starve and gains no nutrition from anything other than sentient creatures.
