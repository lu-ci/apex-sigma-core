description:
  The Sugar Nuzzle is a small, furry animal that hides in tiny caves in mountains.
  They are rare and hard to find due to living in very high and cold places.
  Ancient rulers would spare no expense in catching them as their fur is so soft
  that some call fabric made out of it "gods' silk".
