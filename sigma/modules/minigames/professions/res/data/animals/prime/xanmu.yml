description:
  The Xanmu is a swollen, ugly creature. Standing the size of a man, it is a shaped like a teardrop, but dark green in colour. 
  It is supported by 3 stumpy legs, which are both more muscular and faster than their appearance would indicate. 
  Its oval body has three long, distended arms jutting out at odd angles, ending in a humanoid-looking hand. 
  No two Xanmu have arms in the same places. Similarly, the body houses between two and six eyes, though occasions of more have been recorded.
