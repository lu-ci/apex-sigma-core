description:
  Small, black, purple and gold. Very cute, surely you'd love one as a pet.
  This fish, however, poses enormous magical power.
  Some evaluate that it could probably transfer the moon into another dimension or plane of existence!
  Don't get it mad and treat it well, they're surely sentient.
