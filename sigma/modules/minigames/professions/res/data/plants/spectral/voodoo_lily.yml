  The Voodoo Lily is indeed an evil looking plant,
  the part that gets the most attention is its dark purple flower.
  The purple flower only lasts about three to four days and reveals
  a dark seed cob after it withers and falls off. Despite its appearance,
  the Voodoo Lily is quite hard and can survive in most climates.
  The most interesting fact about this foreboding plant? It can give off
  quite a stink, and some have even likened it to the smell of a dead possum.
