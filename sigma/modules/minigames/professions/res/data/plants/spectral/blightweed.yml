description:
  Nothing about this plant's appearence is special.
  It does have unique and strong properties.
  When cooked as tea, it will make the poor soul who drank it go into a rage.
  Nobody who drank it survived, as they are either killed in self defense,
  or commit suicide when no target is in their field of view.
