description:
  If idle hands are the devil’s workshop,
  we’re not really sure what the Devil’s Hands are,
  but we sure love to look at them!
  Some call this tree the Monkey’s Hand or Monkey Paw,
  but we wouldn’t recommend making any wishes on it.
  The fruit produced by this tree has an earthy taste and has been
  used for years in traditional medicine to treat heart disease and heart
  conditions. Unlike some tropical plants the Devil’s Hand tree is
  extremely hardy and can grow relatively fast.
