description:
  Also known as the False Bird of Paradise and Wild Plantain,
  the Lobster Claw’s cheerful flowers emerge from clumps of leaves that look like bananas.
  The reddish flower-like bracts actually hide the plant’s true flowers,
  which require birds with specialised beaks for pollination.
  An excellent landscape plant, the Lobster Claw can grow up to a height of 3.5'
  tall and they bloom several times each year.
