description:
  The peony daisy is characterized by its delicate, pink flowers,
  which contrast nicely with its center penis, or "stem." Once mature,
  the center of the flower becomes flaccid and limp.
  The peony daisy is the perfect flower to embellish your side yard,
  adding just the right amount of phallic imagery to your home and garden.
