description:
  The Hammer Orchid, also nicknames the King-in-His-Carriage.
  This teeny little flower is easy to miss, but if you’re lucky enough to find it,
  you’ll likely never forget it. The design of the Hammer Orchid,
  named for its ability to reset itself, is intended on luring wasps for pollination.
  In fact, the flower secretes a pheromone that mimics that of the female wasp,
  which lures unsuspecting males to land on its dark purple labellum.
  Once the wasp lands, the labellum moves back towards the pocket of pollen,
  shoving the wasp into the pollen and successfully propagating its species.
