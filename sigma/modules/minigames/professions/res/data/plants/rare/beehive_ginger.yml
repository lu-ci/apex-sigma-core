description:
  Beehive Gingers may look like they belong to the pine cone
  family but they are actually related to the ginger plant.
  Their little "cups" or "honeycombs", actually called bracts,
  will collect water and give off the fragrance of ginger.
  These flowers can be cultivated indoors but require lots of room and a large pot,
  some growing to the height of 6 feet. The flowers are tiny and white,
  sometimes resembling little honeybees, and they appear between the brachts.
  The bracts themselves turn from lovely yellow and golden colours to red.
  Beehive Ginger as a cut flower is highly prized because the bracts and flowers
  last for a very long time after being cut.
