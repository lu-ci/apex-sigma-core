  The Moth Orchid is the most common type of orchid and bears the name because
  of its supposed resemblance to a moth in flight.
  The Moth Orchid isn’t exactly hard to find, and it comes in nearly every
  colour of the rainbow.

  The Moth Orchid’s uncanny ability to have multiple blooming periods,
  when grown in optimal conditions of course!
