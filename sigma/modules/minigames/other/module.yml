      Starts a sequence guessing game.
      4 symbols will randomly be chosen and
      you have to guess them in 6 tries or fewer.
      When a symbol is in the corret position the diamond will be blue.
      If it is in the sequence but incorrect position, it will be yellow.
      If the symbol is not in the sequence, a red triangle will be shown.
      The symbols can repeat, the Kud award is 50.

    description:
      Gives a random number from 0 to 100.
      You can specify the highest number the function calls by
      adding a number after the command.
      The Number TECHNICALLY does not have a limit but the bigger you use,
      the bigger the message, which just looks plain spammy.
