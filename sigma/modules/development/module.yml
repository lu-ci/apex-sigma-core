      Executes a shell command. Extreme warning!
      This executes commands in the Operating System's Shell.
      Command Prompt on Windows and Bash on Linux.
      It will execute things on the same level of authority as the program is ran by.
      Meaning, don't do something stupid and wipe your damn root.
